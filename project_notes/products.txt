Project 3 requires three products with 5 properties:
1. name: "string"
2. price: #number
3. quantity: 0 (Should start at zero)
4. ProductID: #number (unique ID like proudct UPC)
5. image: "urlString" (picture of product)

After products are made, they will need to be placed into:
*products*: [array];

Once products are in *products*: [array];, they will display on storefront.

Things to think about...
- Does each products have a unique ID?
- How to access the images in */images* folder?
- How to put pruduct(s) into *products*: [array];?
