All code will be writen in *script.js* located in *src/assets* folder

Start with a Plan -
Suggested Plan:
1. Review starter code - especially script.js where you will be doing all of your work.
2. Build the products - Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
3. Create the cart functionality - Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
4. Create the checkout functionality - Test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
5. Refactor your code to improve its appearance and functionality
6. Test before submission - You should be testing as you build, 
    but it's always good to do one more set of tests before you submit the project.
    You'll also want to review the Project Rubric to ensure that you have met all of the requirements.
