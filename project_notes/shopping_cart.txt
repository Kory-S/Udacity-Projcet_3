There is already an "Add to Cart" button. Functionality will need to be added
4 functions are need to get this working:
- addProductToCart()
- increaseQuantity()
- decreasequantity()
- removeProductFromCart()
All functions MUST accept SKU as argument because the SKU is used to determine which product needs to be adjusted to cart.

Thigns to think about...
- Getting product from SKU will be the most challenging part
- How to check if product is in cart to avoid the same product listed in cart twice

__________________________________________________________

*addProductToCart()*
- Adding product should incrase product's cart quantity to 1.
   Cart visual is populated by objects constained in *cart*
- If product is in cart, clicking "add to cart" should ONLY increase cart quantity.
- If done correctly, clicking button will render item into cart with new "+", "-", and "remove" buttons.
__________________________________________________________

*increaseQuantity()*
- This function is tied to "+" button
   Clicking should increase quantity displayed in cart
- Buttton only needs to increase cart quantity - assume there is unlimited stock.

__________________________________________________________

*decreaseQuantity()*
- This function is tied to "-" button
   Clicking should decrease quantity displayed in cart
- Product should be REMOVED if "quantity: 0" instead of displaying;
   "quantity: 0" should removed product from array

__________________________________________________________

*removeProductFromCart()*
- This function is tied to "remove" button
   Clicking should remove product from cart regardless of quantity and set back to 0.
